# ROSIE: The Reptilian Offspring Sex and Incubation Environment Database

Welcome to the Reptilian Offspring Sex and Incubation Environment (ROSIE) Database!

ROSIE contains two main data files:

-"SDM.csv" contains species-level sex-determining mechanism classifications (GSD, TSD) and subclassifications (XY, ZW, Ia, Ib, II).

-"Database.csv" contains measurements of offspring sex and associated incubation conditions, such as temperature or application of chemicals.

Explanations of variables can be found in the "Metadata.csv" file. "Exclusions.csv" contains a list of publications from our systematic literature search that were excluded from the "Database.csv" file, as well as the reason for their exclusion.

Please contact Caleb Krueger (kruegeca@gmail.com) to submit additional data for inclusion in the database, or to correct identified errors.

Additional databases you may be interested in:

-The Reptile Development Database (Noble et al. 2018, Scientific Data; https://repdevo.com/) - measures of various phenotypes as relates to incubation temperature, including sex ratio, survival, morphology, growth, and more.

-The Tree of Sex Database (The Tree of Sex Consortium 2014, Scientific Data; http://treeofsex.org/) - sexual system and sex-determining mechanism classifications for eukaryotes.

-CHROMOREP: A Reptiles Chromosomes Database (http://chromorep.univpm.it/) - karyological data for available reptile species.

The initial version of ROSIE focuses solely on the order Testudines. Future updates will expand coverage to include all non-avian reptiles, and biannual updates will maintain its up-to-date nature. Changes to the database will be outlined here in future versions, and all versions are available at 10.5281/zenodo.4670573.

v1.0.1

-General data corrections, addition of new sources published during or before 2020

v1.0.2

-General data corrections, addition of new sources published since last update

-Edited locations to include coordinates for both source population and captive location where relevant

-Added rough estimate of lat-long range for locations

-Coordinates for broad locations (e.g., "Florida, USA") now based on overlap of given location name and species range maps from the Turtles of the World Species checklist (https://iucn-tftsg.org/checklist/) rather than the given location alone

-Changes to "Metadata.csv" to reflect addition/removal/renaming of select columns

-Added two additional "Source" columns to "SDM.csv" file

v1.0.3

-General data corrections, addition of new sources published since last update
